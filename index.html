	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Hello, my name is Jing Hao, and I am from China. I came to America three and a half years ago for college education, so this is my last year in college. 
	My hometown is Shijiazhuang city, a city near the Capital--Beijing. My parents and other relatives all live in China, except my uncle and his familiy. My 
	uncle, his wife and his two kids live in LA, California, and we celebrated each Chrismas together since I came to the U.S. During last winter break, my 
	cousins and I went on a vacation in Orlando, Florida. The Harry Potter theme park and the Disney World are really amazing and we had a great time there. 
	Here are some photos we took during this vacation. </P>
